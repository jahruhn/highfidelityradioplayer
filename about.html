High Fidelity Radio Player

# High Fidelity Radio Player

High Fidelity Radio Player is a small, browser-based internet radio player that enhances streams with real-time audio effects (expander, exciter) and optional AutoEQ headphone/earbud profiles.

Features
- Real-time audio FX chain: Expander → Exciter (order selectable) — implemented in [index.html](index.html) via functions like [`getFxParamsAuto`](index.html) and [`makeExciterCurve`](index.html).
- Stereo level meter and analyser driven by [`startLevelMeter`](index.html).
- AutoEQ profiles (10-band peaking EQ) selectable from the UI and applied with [`applyAutoEq`](index.html). Profiles are defined in the [`autoEqProfiles`](index.html) object.
- Song/stream connection info fetched by [`fetchSongInfo`](index.html).
- Lightweight single-file web UI: open [index.html](index.html) in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Quick start
1. Open the local file [index.html](index.html) in your browser or host the folder on a static web server.
2. Paste a stream URL into the Stream URL field and click "Play Stream".
3. Optionally select an AutoEQ profile or change the FX order.

URL parameter
- You can auto-populate the stream input by adding a query parameter:
  - Example: https://highfidelityradioplayer.com/index.html?stream=https://radio.example.com/stream

Notes
- Streams must support CORS and use browser-compatible codecs (MP3/AAC) for in-page playback with audio FX.
- If metadata (ICY) is not available or the server blocks cross-origin requests, the player will still attempt playback but may not show song info.
